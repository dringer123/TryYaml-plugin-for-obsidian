A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) designed to batch convert [Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) YAML templates into well-structured, information-rich Markdown notes. Tailored for cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and vulnerability researchers, it helps you integrate scattered vulnerability templates into your powerful personal knowledge base.

With an optional AI feature (powered by Tongyi Qianwen), this plugin can also automatically refine vulnerability descriptions, translate content, and generate professional remediation suggestions, greatly enhancing the usability and readability of your templates.

# Atlassian Confluence Path Traversal (CVE-2021-26085)

> [!NOTE] Metadata
> - **Author**: dwisiswant0
> - **Severity**: high
> - **Category**: [[cves]]
> - **Related Template**: [[cves/CVE-2021-26085.yaml]]

## Vulnerability Description
A path traversal vulnerability exists in Atlassian Confluence Server versions prior to 7.12.2. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted URI to access the `/WEB-INF/web.xml` file, which may lead to the disclosure of sensitive configuration information and potential further attacks.

## Remediation Suggestions
1.  **Upgrade Immediately**: It is strongly recommended to upgrade Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center to version 7.12.3 or later to fix this vulnerability.
2.  **Temporary Mitigation**: If an immediate upgrade is not possible, apply the official temporary patch provided by Atlassian or follow their mitigation guidelines.
3.  **Access Control**: Restrict access to the Confluence instance to trusted IP addresses only and use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious requests.

## Http
```yaml
http:
  - method: GET
    path:
      - "{{BaseURL}}/s/{{rand_int(1,10000)}}{{rand_int(1,10000)}}/../../../../WEB-INF/web.xml"
    matchers:
      - type: word
        words:
          - <web-app
          - <display-name>Confluence</display-name>
        condition: and
        part: body
# ... other sections
```
